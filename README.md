## Approach
1. The modules have been developed following the MVVM design pattern, leveraging the benefits of dynamic data binding between the views and the view models.
2. As far as the screens are concerned, for both the Movie List and the Details I have used compositional layouts for collection views to seamlessly render the UI.

## Additional Features 

1. Support for Dark Mode 
2. Image Caching
3. Pull to Refresh
4. Haptic Feedback
